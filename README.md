# EMG-analog-processing-circuit
In this project, I have designed and simulated a circuit which is able to amplify and filter an EMG input signal. It contains an instrumentation amplifier, a sallen-key low pass filter following a sallen-key high pass filter, and a non-inverting amplifier. The simulation is done using LTSpice.
